Florobot is a simple implementation of a Telegram bot written in Go, focused in entertainment with commands to crack jokes, roast people if it gets insulted, answer questions with random facts, play to the russian roulette with friends or scrape contents of webs to retrieve it later through commands or notifications.

This bot has been designed as much modular as possible, so making any modification to the existing solution is easy. Feel free to modify, correct any part or play with it, this project was taken as a side project to learn Go, so it is likely that some parts do not follow the standard!
